Prototype selection

Given a set of n elements (S) and their pairwise distances in terms of a
skbio distance matrix (DM) and a given number (k << n), find the sub-set (s)
consisting of exactly k elements, such that s best represents the full set S.

Here, we define "best represents" as maximizing the sum of distances between
all points, i.e. sum {over a,b in S} DM[a,b]. This is our objective function.

This problem is known to be NP-hard [1], thus we need to resort to heuristics.
This module implements several heuristics, whose quality can be measured by
the objective function for each problem instance, since there is no global
winner. Currently implemented are:
 - prototype_selection_constructive_maxdist
 - prototype_selection_destructive_maxdist
 - prototype_selection_constructive_protoclass
 - prototype_selection_constructive_pMedian
For completeness, the exact but exponential algorithm is implemented, too.

    dm: skbio.stats.distance.DistanceMatrix
        Pairwise distances for all elements in the full set S.
    num_prototypes: int
        Number of prototypes to select for distance matrix.
        Must be >= 2, since a single prototype is useless.
        Must be smaller than the number of elements in the distance matrix,
        otherwise no reduction is necessary.
    seedset: iterable of str
        A set of element IDs that are pre-selected as prototypes. Remaining
        prototypes are then recruited with the prototype selection algorithm.
        Warning: It will most likely violate the global objective function.

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        A sequence holding selected prototypes, i.e. a sub-set of the
        IDs of the elements in the distance matrix.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The number of prototypes to be found should be at least 2 and at most
        one element smaller than elements in the distance matrix. Otherwise, a
        ValueError is raised.
